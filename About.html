    <h2 class="text-background-2">TOAST?</h2>
    <p class="text-background">
      TOAST, YOU FUCKERS, IT IS THE KEY TO EVERYTHING! Do not you see it? That
      toaster sitting in your kitchen is not just a machine, it is a fucking
      interdimensional portal! Every time you slide in a slice, you are sending
      bread into the cosmic realm, and it comes back CRISP, GOLDEN, and FULL OF
      GOD'S FUCKING ENERGY! The crunch? That is the universe speaking through
      the bread! And the warmth? It is PURE DIVINE LIGHT, flowing straight into
      your soul, mate! THEY do not want you to know this—THEY ARE HIDING IT—but
      toast, toast is the fucking answer! The secret to everything! The fucking
      government is keeping us blind! WAKE UP! You are not just eating
      breakfast, you are connecting to the higher powers, mate! Each bite takes
      you closer to goddamn ENLIGHTENMENT! Fuck meditation, fuck yoga—just pop
      in a slice of bread, wait for the ding, and you will feel the divine truth
      flowing through your veins. But no! You are too busy with your eggs and
      coffee to see it! OPEN YOUR EYES, SHEEPLE! Toast is the key to the fucking
      universe! Trust the bread, follow the crumbs, and ASCEND!
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-background-2">Bleeding Toast</h2>
    <p class="bleeding-toast text-background" id="Bleeding-bread">
      TOAST CAN BLEED, YOU KNOW! Yeah, I bet no one ever told you that! You
      think it's just harmless bread getting a little crispy, right? WRONG. You
      ever cut into a slice too fast and BAM—crumbs everywhere? That's not
      crumbs, mate, that&#39;s toast BLOOD! Yeah, when you over-toast it,
      it&#39;s like you&#39;re burning its soul, and the poor slice just can't
      handle it. You ever notice how when you spread butter, it soaks right in?
      That&#39;s toast soaking up its own tears. The butter is basically a
      bandage for its wounds! And don&#39;t even get me started on jam—it&#39;s
      like toast&#39;s lifeblood, oozing out with every bite. People think jam
      is a topping. No, it&#39;s toast blood! Strawberry, raspberry, all that
      red? That's toast in its final form, bleeding out in delicious fruity
      glory. It&#39;s crying out for mercy, and what do we do? Slather it on,
      shove it in our mouths, and crunch away like monsters! So next time you
      make toast, take a moment of silence for the brave slice you&#39;re about
      to devour, because toast bleeds... but damn, it tastes amazing.
